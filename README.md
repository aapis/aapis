- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @aapis aka Ryan Priebe
- I like databases, automation, macOS apps, privacy and NON-GENERATIVE chatbots
- I work regularly with PHP and Swift, but have many years experience with Python, Ruby, various shell scripting languages, plus a wee bit of C#, Obj-C and C++.
- Currently building iOS/macOS apps (search "Ryan Priebe" on the Apple app stores to see them all).
